## Overview

I had a lot of fun making this project and testing out my knowlege of responsive design. I still have some areas to work on but feel its a step in the right direction. I added in a little javascript to have the stat numbers count up to just add another element.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I started with laying out the HTML. Then started the css for desktop before starting the media screen sizes for responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
  -JS for animation

### What I learned

I learned about flexbox a bit more to get things to wrap down but still working on making images responsive.

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn about grouping things and classes to make things easier and not repeat code. I also need to continue to work on making thigs responsive.
